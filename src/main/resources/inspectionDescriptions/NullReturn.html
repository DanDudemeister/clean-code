            Your method returns null which is a bad habit and can easily lead to bugs.

        <p>
            The proposed QuickFix will wrap the returned values with an <code>Optional</code> and all places where the method is called will have an added <code>.orElse(null)</code> so that the behaviour remains the same. Please visit these places afterwards to think of how you want to handle an empty <code>Optional</code>.
